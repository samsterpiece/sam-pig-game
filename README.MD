There are two ways to play the pig game:

1. Through the deployed Netlify site: https://sam-pig-game.netlify.app/

2. In your command terminal: Use the command npm start to start it up locally. This was done through static file serving for one's preference. 

Rules of the game are as follows:

 * If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
 * If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
 * If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
* Snake Eyes is when a player's dies <b>both</b> are 1's. The player scores nothing on their turn, their total score goes to 0, and their turn ends. </li>
* Any double matching dies that are rolled(except Snake eyes), the sum of the dice is added to the current score, but The player cannot "hold" and must roll again.
