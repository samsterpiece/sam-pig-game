                    <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the
                        player decides to "hold":</p>

                    <p>The rules are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
                        </li>
                        <li> If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's
                            turn
                            continues.</li>
                        <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes
                            the
                            next
                            player's turn.</li>
                        <li>Snake Eyes is when a player's dies <b>both</b> are 1's. The player scores nothing on
                            their
                            turn,
                            their total score goes to 0, and their turn ends. </li>
                        <li>Any double matching dies that are rolled(except Snake eyes), the sum of the dice is
                            added to
                            the current score,
                            but <b>The player cannot "hold" and must roll again.</b></li>
                    </ol>

        <!-- <div class="help-tip" class="modalDialog">
            <p>Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a simple dice game where players take turns to roll a single dice
                as many times as they wish. The rules are quite simple:
                <br>
                <br>
                1. If a player rolls a one, it becomes the next player's turn.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. If a player rolls any other number, it is added to the "Current Score" and player turn continues
                until a "1" shows up or until the player decides to hold.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. When a player holds, the current total is transferred to the total score and player's turn ends,
                going to the next player.
                <br>
                <br>
                4. When a player gets a "1" on both dies, snake eyes is called where player scores nothing, total score
                goes to 0, and their turn ends.
